#RideMyWay - Ride-Sharing Platform

Overview
RideMyWay is a simple Python application designed to simulate a ride-sharing platform where drivers can offer rides and passengers can share transportation costs if they are headed in the same direction. Unlike other ride-hailing apps like Uber, RideMyWay focuses on a cost-sharing model for rides. It can be observed that a typical private car is usually occupied by 2-3 people at most; this application allows drivers who wish to make the most of their available seats while reducing travel costs for passengers.

This simple python application demonstrates key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, and uses Python's object-oriented features to define different user roles (Driver and Passenger) and manage rides and requests.
